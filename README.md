# bash-libs-tools

A collection of libs and tools for bash (and possibly zsh?).

Simply `source main.sh` to use.

# Current status

- related functions are grouped into so-called packages which prefix a function's name, eg "git.update_repo" is in package "git".
- functions do not have "help" switch but are, i think, decently documented where it made sense.
- a big body of code - can be broken into smaller pieces in the if the need arises.
